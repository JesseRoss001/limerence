                <p class="text-muted">Mindfulness is a central theme throughout my program and has been shown to improve anxiety, depression, immune functioning, mental clarity and focus, sleep, and overall quality of life. In their systematic review on “Meditation Programs for Stress and Well-Being,” Goyal, Singh, Sibinga et al. found that mindfulness meditation programs reduce psychological stress associated with depression and anxiety, to the extent that regular meditation was analogous to using psychotropic medication. In other words, mindfulness has the potential to improve the way we respond to stressors.</p>

<!-- Lived Experience and Approach Section -->
<div class="container my-5">
    <h2 class="text-center text-dark mb-4">My Approach</h2>
    <div class="card approach-card p-4">
        <p class="text-muted">Developing this program has given me the freedom to share parts of my lived experience, which are vital in aiding treatment. In working with me, I have crafted a structured plan to target the depths of limerence. While structured, I invite questions and exploration, which are integral to recovery. Although I am educated and trained in providing psychotherapy, it is also my lived experience which colors my style of care and support. Through suffering, I have acquired seeds of wisdom which I believe will be valuable in our work together.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">My approach is compassionate and client-centered, focusing on individual strengths and resilience. Together, we will explore your unique experiences and develop strategies to enhance your well-being and overcome the challenges posed by limerence. I believe in the transformative power of personal growth and look forward to supporting you on your journey.</p>
